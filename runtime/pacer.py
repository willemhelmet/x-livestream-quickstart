"""The pacer: turn clip-shaped model output into a constant-rate broadcast.

fast-h3's output is clips with black holds in between — frames arrive at a
strict 24 fps *while a clip plays* and not at all while the queue idles or the
Reactor connection is being rebuilt. An RTMP ingest (and any live sink) needs
the opposite: a frame every period and audio every period, forever, or players
stall and the platform drops the broadcast.

The pacer is the adapter between the two. It is a drift-free metronome at the
model's frame rate; each tick it:

  * pops the oldest buffered video frame (or repeats the last one shown, or
    black before anything arrived) and hands it to the sink;
  * pulls exactly one tick's worth of int16 samples from the audio buffer
    (padding with silence on underflow) and hands those to the sink.

Both media types are buffered FIFO with the same shallow cap, which is what
keeps them in sync: while a clip plays, both buffers stay near-empty and
frames flow through with the same tiny delay; while nothing plays, both run
dry and the pacer emits repeats + silence. Overflow (the model briefly ahead
of the clock) drops the oldest entries of each, and is counted.

The pacer never touches the Reactor connection and never stops on its own —
it is created once, outlives session reconnects, and is cancelled only at
shutdown. That is what keeps the platform-side stream uninterrupted while the
client rebuilds a session behind it.
