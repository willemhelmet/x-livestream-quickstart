"""The director: viewer prompts in, tagged scene groups on the model's queue.

One prompt from chat becomes one *scene group*: the upsampler expands it into
1..N self-contained scenes — a single shot, or a chunked short story — and
the director enqueues them contiguously on the fast-h3 queue. The director is
also the *playout* brain: the model's autoplay starts the playout front the
instant the stream idles (gapless), and `run_playout` curates that front with
`move` — viewer content before filler, judged purely from the metadata echo
(`pick_next` in `group_tag.py`), because who asked for a clip is client-side
knowledge the model deliberately never has. Rules that keep it coherent:

  * The director is the queue's only writer. Both writers inside it — the
    viewer worker (`run`) and the idle filler (`run_idle`) — serialize group
    enqueues through one lock, so groups can never interleave.
  * A group is only enqueued when the whole group fits the generation
    queue (after evicting waiting filler if needed), so it cannot get stuck
    half-in; a backlog already full of viewer content drops new prompts
    instead of stalling them behind a wait. Every capacity is whatever the
    connected deployment reports in `state_update`, never a constant.
  * Viewer prompts outrank filler, and stay first-come-first-served among
    themselves: viewer groups insert into the generation queue ahead of
    waiting filler and behind waiting viewer clips (`enqueue`'s `position`),
    the playout loop pops one built filler per tick when a full playout
    queue blocks a viewer's build, and the idle filler stands down whenever
    viewer work is pending.

Every scene carries the group's identity in the clip's `metadata` — an opaque
string fast-h3 stores and echoes back on every message that references the
clip. That is what lets this client (or any overlay built on it) reconstruct
"scene 2/3 of *Neon Alley* by viewer_42" from a `clip_started` alone, without
joining ids against local state that a reconnect may have lost. The same tag
carries `generated: true` on filler clips, which is what makes them
recognizably evictable later — including by a director restarted with no
memory of enqueueing them.

Viewer prompts pass moderation before they reach the upsampler; the curated
idle list does not need it (see `moderator.py` for the policy).
